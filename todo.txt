- add a Database type, based on a bagarray, complete with sort, search, filter, etc. (or just do
  that on BagArray?) - with indices?
- BagObject provides the relational component of bdatabase, indexing multiple tables by name

- in BagArray, allow string based indexing for a 'put' operation
- rename 'getObject' to 'get'?
- consider hiding the anonymous type verion of put/add - users get confused that they can't
  add any old type.
- 'putType' and 'getType' methods that invoke the Serializer?
- should the serializer be automatically invoked when objectify fails with an unknown type? I think
  not, because the user will otherwise have to know to extract via the serializer
- iterators?
- "public" sweep
- javadoc sweep
- replace logging with a BagObject that contains the "last error", kind of like an exception
- look into the HttpRequest support for "Accepts" replies - do I need to add JOSN to the list?

Formats to support
- reader auto-detect the format?
- XML (application/xml or text/xml)
- CSV (application/csv or text/csv)
- Kml file format for google maps
- web post format (application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data)
- web URL format ()
- Other?

Ways to create a BagObject (or BagArray):
- new BagObject ().put(...);
- new BagObject (5).put(...).put(...).put(...).put(...).put(...);
- new BagObject (oldBagObject);
- new BagObject (String input);
- new BagObject (String format, String input);
- new BagObject (String format, InputStream inputStream);
- new BagObject (String format, File file);
- new BagObject (File file);

Ways to get the formats to use:
- ask the user to provide one (what if they say null?)
- if there's only one registered way, always use that?
- use the extension of the filename (if present)
- check the inputString itself ("<" vs. "{" vs. "[" as the first character...), have the formatreader
  do this?
- magic
